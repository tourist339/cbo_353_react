The new technology used is React

Reason for choosing React

In part A , I used node/express to send html files to the client and load them
As html files are static resources , I had to write a lot of javascript code to send requests to server and then
based on the data returned from the server , javascript created dynamic elements on the html page and for each
dynamic element I had to use a unique id which was becoming very cumbersome
Also , there was a lot of copy pasting code and I could not really generalise common elements which are there in every page
like navbar. and also changing  href for an anchor tag in the navbar meant going to every single html file and editing it's
code

React removed this problem by allowing to use resuable react components
