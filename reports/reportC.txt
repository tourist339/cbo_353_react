ReactJS is a frontend library . Here are it's key concepts
    -React uses JSX (Javascript syntax extension) to create html elements .JSX's syntax is similar to HTML

    - React allows us to contain functional or class components which have their own state values and
    a set of JSX and functions which allows us to reuse the components in different pages and still mantain the structure

    - We can pass data to a react component and then access data from the component's props object

    - React Components also have state values which is used to store data for the current state of the object . Whenever
    a particular state value changes , the elements rendered using that state value are rerendered according to the new
    state value.

    - React uses it's own Virtual DOM tree which listens to the changes in state and update the original DOM only where
    the state change has occured rather than rendering the whole Document Tree again. This allows fast rendering of the
    data compared to using only javascript
